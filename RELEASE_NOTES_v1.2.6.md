# 🚀 DDNS Updater v1.2.6 Release Notes

**Release Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Package:** `ddns-updater_1.2.6-1_amd64.deb` (2.0MB)

## 🎯 Major Features

### ⚡ **Performance Optimization - Selective Config Processing**
The biggest improvement in this release: **intelligent selective processing** of configuration files.

**Before v1.2.6:** All config files processed on every run
**After v1.2.6:** Only configs that actually need updates are processed

#### Key Optimizations:
- **Smart IP Change Detection**: Only process configs when IP actually changes
- **File-specific Validation**: Only update configs that contain the old IP address  
- **Conditional Backup Creation**: Only create backups when files will actually be modified
- **Early Termination**: Skip all processing when no IP change is detected

#### Performance Impact:
```
Example: 10 config files, only 2 contain the target IP

v1.2.5: Processes all 10 files + creates 10 backups = 20 operations
v1.2.6: Processes only 2 files + creates 2 backups = 4 operations
        
Result: 80% reduction in unnecessary operations!
```

### 🔒 **Security Hardening - Restricted Systemd Permissions**
Enhanced security through **principle of least privilege** implementation.

#### Changes:
- **Before**: Systemd write access to entire `/data/nginx` directory
- **After**: Systemd write access **only** to `/data/nginx/proxy_host` subdirectory

#### Benefits:
- Reduces potential attack surface
- Limits file system access to only necessary directories
- Maintains full functionality while improving security posture

## 📊 **Real-world Performance Example**

Testing with 5 nginx config files:
```
🔄 IP change detected, processing 5 config files
DEBUG: Config file doesn't contain old IP, no update needed for this file (×4)
✅ Updated google.com: 142.250.102.139 → 142.250.102.101
📊 Summary: Updated: 1, No change: 4, Errors: 0
```

**Result**: Only 1 file updated, 4 files intelligently skipped, only 1 backup created.

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### Optimization Logic:
1. **Global IP Check**: Resolve current IP once per hostname
2. **Early Termination**: If IP unchanged, skip all config processing  
3. **Per-File Validation**: For each config, check if it contains the old IP
4. **Selective Processing**: Only process files that need actual updates
5. **Conditional Backups**: Create backups only when files will be modified

### Security Implementation:
- Updated systemd service files: `ddns-updater.service` and `ddns-updater@.service`
- Restricted `ReadWritePaths` from `/data/nginx` to `/data/nginx/proxy_host`
- Enhanced Docker documentation with security scope clarification

## 🚀 **Installation**

### New Installation:
```bash
# Download and install
sudo apt install ./ddns-updater_1.2.6-1_amd64.deb

# Or with dpkg
sudo dpkg -i ddns-updater_1.2.6-1_amd64.deb
```

### Upgrade from Previous Version:
```bash
sudo apt install ./ddns-updater_1.2.6-1_amd64.deb
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart ddns-updater.service
```

## 🔄 **Backward Compatibility**

**Fully backward compatible** with existing installations:
- All existing configuration files work unchanged
- Same command-line interface
- Same configuration directories supported
- Existing systemd services continue to work

## 📈 **Migration Benefits**

Upgrading to v1.2.6 provides:
- **Significant performance improvement** for multi-config setups
- **Enhanced security** through restricted file access
